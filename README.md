## Overview:

In this assignment, a command line interface (CLI) node app was created which closely resembles Amazon Market Place . This app will take in orders from customers and adjust stock from the store's inventory. Additionally, the app tracks product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
