# bamazon

## Overview:

For this assignment, we were to create a node application called "Bamazon" that takes in commands lines from the user. This app closely resembles Amazon where it will take in orders from customers and adjust your store's inventory, and tracks product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Technologies Used:

- Node.JS runtime
- MySQL database npm-package
- Inquirer npm-package
- CLI-table npm-package
- DotEnv npm-package

## Usage:

### Customer view

> node bamazonCustomer.js

### Manager view

### Supervisor view

> node bamazonSupervisor.js
